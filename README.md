# KnowUNI
A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information where nodes represent entities (such as people, places, or concepts) and edges represent the relationships between these entities. This network helps in understanding and exploring complex data by showing how things are connected.

**Problem:**<br>
* Students struggle to identify prerequisite skills for courses, leading to confusion and inefficient academic planning.
* Traditional course catalogs provide limited guidance on skill dependencies, making it difficult to choose courses in the correct sequence.
  
**Solution:**<br>
* KnowUNI maps course dependencies through an intelligent recommendation system.
* It allows students to explore courses based on their existing knowledge and skills.

**Features:**<br>
* Course recommendation based on user interests, location, and skills.
* Live location-based university and course search.
* Skill matching to suggest relevant courses.
* Interactive knowledge graph visualization of course prerequisites using D3.js.
